## Technologies Used

- CSS
- JavaScript

## Requirements
- [x] Add the title "Minha Lista de Tarefas" to the list in a header tag.
- [x] Below the title, add a small and discreet paragraph with id="funcionamento" and text "Clique duas vezes em um item para marcÃ¡-lo como completo"
- [x] Add an input with id="texto-tarefa" where the user can enter the name of the item to add to the list
- [x] Add an ordered list of tasks with id="lista-tarefas"
- [x] Add a button with id="criar-tarefa" and clicking it should create a new item at the end of the list, clearing the input text.
- [x] Order the items in the task list by the order of creation.
- [x] Clicking on an item in the list should change the background color to gray rgb(128,128,128).
- [x] It should not be possible to select more than one item from the list at the same time.
- [x] Double-clicking on an item should strike it out, indicating it is complete. It should be possible to undo this action by double-clicking on the item again.
- [x] Add a button with id="apaga-tudo" that, when clicked, deletes all items from the list.
- [x] Add a button with id="remover-finalizados" that, when clicked, removes **only** the completed elements from your list.
- [x] Add a button with id="salvar-tarefas" that saves the content of the list. If you close and reopen the page, the list should remain in the state it was in.
- [x] Add two buttons, one with id="mover-cima" and the other with id="mover-baixo," that allow moving the selected item up or down the task list.
- [x] Add a button with id="remover-selecionado" that, when clicked, removes the selected item.

## Learnings

This was a super fun project, and it's definitely an application I plan to work on a lot, adding various other functionalities. The most challenging part was adding information to Local Storage because it's something I'm not very familiar with yet. But I'm quite pleased with the final result; this is my favorite project so far.
